# Predictive-Modeling-for-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Anticipating customer churn is vital for businesses aiming to sustain growth. 
In this project, the focus is on conducting classification tasks through the application of logistic regression. We introduce the OSEMN data science pipeline, which stands for Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret. This pipeline serves as a comprehensive framework for handling data and building predictive models.

The primary steps covered here include:

☞ Obtain: Gathering the necessary data for analysis and modeling. This involves collecting relevant information about customer behavior, potentially related to churn.

☞ Scrub: Preprocessing and cleaning the acquired data. This step ensures that the data is consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis. Data cleaning involves dealing with missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.

☞ Explore: Exploring the data to gain insights and understanding. This process involves visualizing and summarizing the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential relationships between the target variable (churn) and the explanatory variables (features).

☞ Model: Constructing predictive models using appropriate algorithms. In this chapter, logistic regression is employed as a baseline model for predicting customer churn. Logistic regression is a widely used technique for binary classification tasks.

☞ iNterpret: Interpreting the results of the model. Understanding the relationship between the target variable (churn) and the explanatory variables (features) aids in feature selection and enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.

The central objective of this work is to develop a churn model, which predicts whether customers are likely to churn or not. By performing data exploration, analysts can uncover insights into the factors contributing to churn and subsequently select relevant features for building accurate predictive models. Logistic regression is introduced as a fundamental technique for this purpose.
